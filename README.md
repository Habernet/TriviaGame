World War 2 Trivia game!
This game was built with HTML/CSS/Jquery and Javascript!
This game is meant to demonstrate skills using Jquery to dynamically change a webpage.
It pulls from a pre-defined set of questions and answers and displays this to the user.
The main thing here is the timer for answering each question. The game flow continues without user input.
